My first Repository
<br>Day 1
<br>My first day at GNDEC started all the ECE students assembling in auditorium. Gradually it started, after few minutes host invited Harpreet Mam. Lecture given by Mam made us feel like we are already part of this institute ♥️ 

 <br>Our NSET Director introduced us to it's astonishing history, emphasizing its 70 years of shaping brilliant minds. 
 <br> I learned some essential lesson 
<br> Then we all students visited their department ( according to their branch ) with our allotted Mentors
